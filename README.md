# pythonExercise
This is just a repo to hold scripts I write as I learn and practice Python.

## Fibonacci.py
I saw the original code on [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for the fibonacci sequence. I decided to take it and try myself. The original has the number hard coded into the script but I wanted to be able to pass any number to it as an argument. It took me a little while to figure out the argument was being passed as a string and not an interger and the script would loop forever.

## fortuneCookie.py
Everyone tells me there's already a fortune program in Linux, but I wanted to use the collection of fortunes piling up on my desk and write my own as practice. I ended up only spending about 5 minutes on the actual code, and a few hours typing in all the fortunes.
